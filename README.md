Simple Node Blog
=======

This is my attempt at building a blog using Node.js
(still a work in progress)

### Installation

You need to have Node.js(v0.8.16) and MongoDB(v2.2.2) running.

```
npm install
// for first time running use
node app -s
// otherwise use
node app
```

You'll also have to set a config.js, I have included an example.

### Tests
You have to have jasmine-node running. To install it run...
```
npm install jasmine-node -g
```
Then you can run the tests by turning on the server and run...
```
jasmine-node spec/
```
